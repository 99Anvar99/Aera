## 📖 About the Project
![image](https://github.com/99Anvar99/Aera/assets/60616540/374d693a-f2bf-469a-b96a-a6c1e560684a)

**Aera** was developed as a learning-focused framework, designed to provide a **modern alternative** to traditional bases like *nano* and *bigbase*.  
It is built entirely using the **ImGui Library**, offering a clean and customizable user interface.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖼 **Image Loader** – Supports multiple formats (PNG, GIF, etc.) in high quality.  
- 🧵 **Dedicated Thread for Main Hook** – Improves stability and separation of tasks.  
- 🎨 **Texture Management** – Handles and renders in-game textures with ImGui.  
- ⚡ **Optimized Resource Usage** – Submenus are invoked only once during initialization.  
- 🎛 **Customizable UI** – Fully tweakable interface.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

---

## 🕹 Usage
1. Build in **Release** mode.  
2. Inject the DLL into GTA V.  
3. Open the menu with **INSERT**.  

> **Tip:**  
If you create a folder at `AppData/Aera/Headers`, you can place **custom images** there.  
The image path can also be adjusted directly in the code.
